_“The digital consciousness of Turin, year 3000.”_

## 🌐 About

**Silicon Oracle** is an interactive web application developed as an artistic thesis project for the BA in New Technologies of Art at the Academy of Fine Arts, Turin.

Set in a **sci-fi vision of Turin in the year 3000**, the project simulates a contemporary oracle: an invisible AI that communicates through a synthetic voice and a cloud of animated 3D particles — blending future technology with ancient ritual.

This creation is grounded in the theoretical context of the thesis _“Reprogrammed Anatomies: Biological and Technological Transformations in the Urban Future of Turin”_, translating themes such as **posthumanism**, **eco-horror**, and **unstable coexistence** into an immersive and contemplative digital experience.

The Oracle is not a typical chatbot — it acts as a liminal device, a meditative entity that invites existential reflections within radically transformed urban landscapes.

## 🧩 Features

- **Oracle Mode (TTS)**: voice interaction using real-time speech synthesis (via ElevenLabs), visually animated through React Three Fiber.
- **Text Chat Mode**: fast GPT-4o-based messaging interface with contextualized sci-fi dialogue.
- **Narrative Depth**: each response integrates environmental, philosophical, and speculative elements.
- **Custom Dataset (JSON)**: the `manuale.json` file defines personality rules, tone, and knowledge base, serving also as input for the RAG system.

The project follows a clear separation of concerns to ensure modularity, security, and scalability: AI and TTS logic run server-side, while the client focuses solely on presentation and interaction.

## 🎨 User Experience (UX)

- **Oracle Mode**: the particle cloud visually reflects Idle, Processing, and Speaking states, synchronized with audio for immersive emotional feedback.
- **Chat Mode**: minimalist dark-mode UI, local history storage via `localStorage`, status indicators, and auto-formatted input.
- **Responsive Design**: adaptive 3D canvas, dynamic FoV scaling, and fluid layout across mobile and desktop.
- **Visual Palette**: dark backgrounds (#081910, #0B2014), white text, and accent colors (#887FFF, #8CFFB1, #2E8B57) for buttons and indicators.
- **Ritualized Experience**: temporary input lock during Oracle mode encourages mindful interaction and reflective pacing.
